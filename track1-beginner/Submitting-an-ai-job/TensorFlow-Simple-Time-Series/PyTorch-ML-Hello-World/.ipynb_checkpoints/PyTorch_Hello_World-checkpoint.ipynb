    "In this notebook, we are going to take a baby step into the world of deep learning using PyTorch. There are a ton of notebooks out there that teach you the fundamentals of deep learning and PyTorch, so here the idea is to give you some basic introduction to deep learning and PyTorch at a very high level. Therefore, this notebook is targeting beginners but it can also serve as a review for more experienced developers.\n",

    "- Add more examples in the input and output tensors. In addition, try to change the dimensions of the data, say by adding an extra value in each array. What needs to be changed to successfully train the network with the new data?\n",
    "- The model converged really fast, which means it learned the relationship between x and y values after a couple of iterations. Do you think it makes sense to continue training? How would you automate the process of stopping the training after the model loss doesn't subtantially change?\n",
    "- In our example, we used a single hidden layer. Try to take a look at the PyTorch documentation to figure out what you need to do to get a model with more layers. What happens if you add more hidden layers?\n",
    "- We did not discuss the learning rate (`lr-0.001`) and the optimizer in great detail. Check out the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) to learn more about what other optimizers you can use.\n"
